# Vietnamese Culture & Travel Tips

## Tet Nguyen Dan (Lunar New Year)

Tet Nguyen Dan, or simply Tet, is Vietnam's most important holiday of the year. Tet occurs in the first lunar month, usually falling between late January and mid-February. It's a time for family reunions, ancestor worship, and wishing good luck for the new year. Before Tet, Vietnamese people clean their homes, buy new things, cook banh chung (square sticky rice cakes) and banh tet (cylindrical sticky rice cakes). During Tet, people wear traditional ao dai, visit each other to exchange wishes, and give lucky money to children. Travelers should know that many shops and restaurants close during Tet (3-7 days). However, it's also a wonderful time to experience authentic Vietnamese culture with festivals and special foods.

## Water Puppetry

Water puppetry is Vietnam's unique traditional performing art with over 1,000 years of history. Wooden puppets are controlled by artists standing in water, hidden behind a bamboo screen. Performances tell stories about rural life and folk legends like Saint Giong, the Golden Turtle God of Hoan Kiem Lake, and lion dances. Background music features traditional instruments like drums, flutes, and two-string fiddles. In Hanoi, visitors can watch water puppet shows at Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre (57B Dinh Tien Hoang). Tickets cost about 100,000-200,000 VND for a 50-minute show. It's advisable to book in advance as shows often sell out.

## Traditional Ao Dai

Ao dai is Vietnam's national costume, especially for women. The outfit consists of a long tunic with slits on both sides that reaches the ankles, worn over loose trousers. Modern ao dai comes in various styles, patterns, and colors. Vietnamese women typically wear ao dai on important occasions like Tet, weddings, and graduation ceremonies. Female students at many high schools wear white ao dai as uniforms. Tourists can rent or have ao dai tailored in Hoi An, Hanoi, or Saigon for photo opportunities. The cost to have an ao dai made ranges from 500,000 to 2,000,000 VND depending on material and intricacy. Ao dai represents Vietnamese elegance and grace.

## Currency

Vietnam's currency is the Vietnamese Dong (VND), symbol ₫. The exchange rate typically ranges around 23,000-25,000 VND per 1 USD. Common denominations: 500,000đ, 200,000đ, 100,000đ, 50,000đ, 20,000đ, 10,000đ. Tourists can exchange money at banks, gold shops, or withdraw from ATMs (widely available in major cities). Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard) are accepted at hotels, upscale restaurants, and shopping centers. However, cash remains the most popular payment method, especially at street food stalls and traditional markets. It's advisable to carry small denominations for convenience.

## Transportation

Vietnam offers various transportation options suitable for different budgets and needs:

**Motorbikes:** The most popular vehicle. Tourists can rent motorbikes for 100,000-150,000 VND/day. An international driver's license is required.

**Taxis:** Reputable taxi companies like Vinasun and Mai Linh have starting fares of 10,000-12,000 VND. Using the Grab app is safer and more transparent.

**Grab:** Motorbike taxi and car service through an app, with transparent pricing, very popular in major cities.

**Buses:** Cheapest option (7,000-20,000 VND/trip) but complex for foreigners. Hop-on Hop-off buses for tourists are available in Hanoi and Saigon.

**Trains:** The North-South railway connects Hanoi and Saigon through coastal cities. Trains have sleeper berths, seats, and air conditioning.

**Flights:** Airlines including Vietnam Airlines, VietJet, and Bamboo Airways offer many affordable domestic flights.

## Safety Tips

1. **Crossing streets:** Vietnamese traffic is very crowded, especially with motorbikes. When crossing, walk slowly and steadily so drivers can avoid you. Don't run or stop suddenly.

2. **Protect belongings:** Be careful with bags and phones when walking, especially in crowded areas. Snatch theft still occurs in some areas.

3. **Drinking water:** Don't drink tap water directly. Buy bottled or filtered water. Ice at large restaurants is usually safe.

4. **Bargaining:** At markets and small shops, bargaining is expected. Initial prices can be 2-3 times higher. Negotiate gently with a smile.

5. **Responsible tourism:** Respect culture, dress modestly when entering pagodas and temples. Don't touch people's heads (disrespectful). Remove shoes when entering homes.
